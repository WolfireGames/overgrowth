## Code of Conduct

The Overgrowth Open Source GitHub is for on-topic discussions and development. It's everyone's responsibility to maintain a positive environment, especially during disagreements.

## How You Can Help

Here are some ways you can contribute. If you can add value in another way, you are more than welcome to do so!

### Reporting Issues

An issue can be either a bug or an idea for improvement, and it is the first step towards change.

To report an issue, first search among the [issues] to see if someone already reported it. If someone did, give the issue a üëç reaction to show that you want it solved too, and write a comment if you have something to add. If the issue does not exist, create it.

### Educating and Documenting

This game engine is big, and as with any software project, some parts can be hard to understand. Documenting the code and how everything works together helps new people get started contributing.

Here are some common ways of documenting:

- Write comments in the code itself and create a pull request. This is useful when documenting specific parts.
- Write external documentation that we can link to or include in the repository. This is useful when documenting the bigger picture.

Learning materials such as tutorials and articles make it easy for people to get started with the engine. For example, how do you add a new character? How do you create a custom campaign? How do you package your work for others?

### Reviewing Code

Even if you aren't a maintainer, you are encouraged to review pull requests. More eyes on code contributions improve the quality of the code.

Go to the [pull requests] and read an existing pull request to start reviewing. With GitHub, you can comment on specific lines in the code to discuss issues or potential improvements.

### Contributing Code

To submit your code for inclusion, create a [pull request][pull requests] on GitHub so people can review your code and give feedback. If your changes align with the goals of the project and the quality is good, we will probably merge it!

You don't need to be a master programmer to submit code. This repository is a place for learning and collaboration, so if your submission isn't ready for merging, maintainers will be happy to give helpful feedback to get it merged eventually.

When one maintainer has reviewed and accepted a contribution, it gets merged into the codebase. Maintainers can accept their own contributions.
