## Contributing to Overgrowth Open Source

Here you can read about different ways you can help the project, and how it’s structured.

## Development Goals

While the [README.md] talks about the project’s goals in the bigger picture, these are the goals for the code itself.

This project aims to serve these groups of people:

- People who want to work on the engine to fix bugs, add features, etc.
- Advanced Overgrowth modders who want a clean slate to build on.
- Less advanced Overgrowth modders who want new features in Overgrowth to build better mods.

## How We’re Organized

The project has a group of trusted maintainers who run the project, and together they have the final say in decisions. They are listed [SOMEWHERE].

## How You Can Help

Here are some of the ways you can contribute. This list is not comprehensive, if you feel you can add value in some other way you are more than welcome to do so!

### Reporting Bugs

Reporting an issue is the first step to getting it solved. Writing good bug reports helps a lot with keeping the engine stable.

To report a bug, first search among the [issues](https://github.com/WolfireGames/overgrowth/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If it has, give the issue a thumbs up to show that you have it too, and write if you have something to add. If the bug is not reported, [create a new issue](https://github.com/WolfireGames/overgrowth/issues/new/choose).

### Educating and Documenting

This game engine is big, and as with any software project, some parts can be hard to understand. Documenting the code and how everything works together helps new people get started contributing.

Two common ways of documenting the code is to either write comments in the code itself and create a pull request, or write separate documentation describing how things work that can be linked to.

Learning materials such as tutorials and articles make it easy for people to get started building things on the engine. For example, how do you add a new character? How do you create a custom campaign? How do you package your work for others?

### Reviewing Code

Even if you aren’t a maintainer you are encouraged to review pull requests, more eyes on code contributions helps improve the quality of the code.

Go to the [pull requests](https://github.com/WolfireGames/overgrowth/pulls) and read an existing pull request to start reviewing. GitHub allows you to comment on specific lines in the code to discuss any issues or places for improvements.

### Contributing Code

To submit your code for inclusion, create a [pull request](https://github.com/WolfireGames/overgrowth/pulls) on GitHub so people can review your code and give feedback. If your changes align with the goals of the project and the quality is good it will probably be merged!

You don't need to be a master programmer to submit code. This is a place for learning and collaboration, so if your submission isn’t ready for merging, maintainers will be happy to give helpful feedback to eventually get it merged.

When two of the maintainers have reviewed and accepted a code contribution, it is accepted into the code base. If the code was written by a maintainer, only one other maintainer needs to accept it.
