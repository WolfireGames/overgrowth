# Scar of Ouruin
This is the incomplete build for Scar of Ouruin, Overgrowth's next expansion and content update. Stability, finish and polish is not guaranteed.
Below is the default Overgrowth readme.

# Overgrowth
This is the official repository for [Overgrowth]'s source code. Only the code is available here; the game data (such as art assets and levels) can only be legally obtained by purchasing Overgrowth from [Wolfire Games].

This repository lets youâ€¥

- Run the open source code with the commercial data to perform experiments for educational purposes.
- Propose changes to be merged back into the commercial game.
- Create modifications for Overgrowth that would otherwise be impossible.
- Use helpful code snippets in your projects.
- Create your own commercial "total conversions" that use an entirely new set of assets.

If you would like to distribute any of the original Overgrowth assets, you must obtain explicit written permission from Wolfire Games.

## Compiling
[COMPILING.md] contains instructions on compiling and running the commercial Overgrowth game using the open source code.

## Contributing
This repository is entirely community-operated. This means you can help by submitting bug reports, reviewing other people's code, contributing your own code, and so on.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md] for more information.

## License
Unless otherwise noted, the code in this repository is licensed under `Apache-2.0`. Read [LICENSE] for the full license.

`Apache-2.0` is a "permissive" open source license, meaning you can use it for more or less whatever you want, including in closed source projects. Licenses are hard to understand, `Apache-2.0` is no exception. Here is a summary of what the license means in practice in most cases. This is not legal advice:

If you distribute a compiled program using the code, or you distribute the code itself, modified or not, you must do the following:

### Include the entire contents of the `LICENSE` file

The license can be somewhere in the program itself or in a separate file. The purpose is to clarify under what license you're using the code. For example, you can have a file called `LICENSES`, and there you can have a line saying `This software uses code from Overgrowth under the Apache-2.0 license, read the full license in the file named LICENSE_APACHE.`.

### Mark files you've changed with a notice

If you distribute the code itself, in each file you modify, write that you have modified it. For instance, the files have a "boilerplate notice" at the top, you can write that you have changed it there, so it looks something like this:

```
//           Name: filename.h
//      Developer: Wolfire Games LLC
//    Modified By: Firstname Lastname
//    Description:
//        License: Read below
```

### Do not remove any copyright notices or similar

You're not allowed to remove things like `Copyright 2022 Company Name` or similar.
