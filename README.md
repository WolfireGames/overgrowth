# Overgrowth Open Source
This is the official repository for the open source game [Overgrowth], which was released by [Wolfire Games] in 2017, and later open sourced in 2022.

Thereâ€™s only code here, since the art assets and levels were not open sourced. Here are the differences between this repository and the closed source version, which is what you get when you purchase the game:

- Some closed source libraries have been removed, they had to do with things like achievements and the optional telemetry.
- The closed source version comes with art and levels, this repository does not.
- This repository (soon) contains some improvements compared to the closed source version.

# Goals
The goal of Overgrowth Open Source is to make the code as useful as possible to the wider game developer community. This repository is meant to accomplish that in the following ways:

Making the code available to be viewed and used by the public.
Providing a place for people to collaborate on the code.

# Compiling
