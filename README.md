# Overgrowth Open Source
This is the official repository for the source code of the game [Overgrowth]. Only the code is available here; the game data (such as art assets and levels) can only be legally obtained by purchasing a copy of Overgrowth from [Wolfire Games].

The intent of this repository is to allow people to‥

- Run the open source code along with the commercial data in order to perform experiments for educational purposes.
- Propose changes that can be merged back into the commercial game.
- Create modifications for Overgrowth that would otherwise be impossible.
- Use useful code snippets in their own projects.
- Create their own commercial "total conversions" that use a completely new set of assets.

If you would like to distribute any of the original Overgrowth assets, you must obtain explicit written permission from Wolfire Games.

# Compiling
Information on how to compile and run the commercial Overgrowth game using the open source code can be found in [COMPILING.md].

# Contributing
This repository is entirely community-owned. That means you are welcome to submit your own improvements, and us volunteer maintainers will review, give feedback, and consider your code for inclusion when we have time.
