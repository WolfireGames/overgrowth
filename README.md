# Overgrowth Open Source
This message is for you who have accepted to be included in discussions around OGOS before it has been made public.

The idea is to sort out any questions about how the project should be managed, so everything is ready before it’s made public. You will find relevant discussions under the “Issues” and “Pull requests” tabs above, so check those out and give your input! Feel free to open your own issues and pull requests too of course.

The code isn’t here yet because it is still being prepared for being open sourced.
